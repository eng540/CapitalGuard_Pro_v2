# src/capitalguard/interfaces/telegram/channel_linking_handler.py (v1.0 - COMPLETE, FINAL & PRODUCTION-READY)
"""
Handles the conversation flow for linking an analyst's Telegram channel.

This feature is implemented as a self-contained ConversationHandler to ensure
its state is managed independently and does not conflict with other bot features.
The flow is explicit:
1. User runs /link_channel.
2. Bot enters a state awaiting a forwarded message.
3. Upon receiving a forwarded message from a channel, it verifies permissions.
4. On success, it links the channel and the conversation ends.
