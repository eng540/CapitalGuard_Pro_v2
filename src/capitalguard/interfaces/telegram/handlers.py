    # These handlers (e.g., /start, /help, /stats) are checked next.

    # Group 2: Conversational Handlers
    # These handlers manage complex, multi-step user interactions like creating a new
    # recommendation. Their entry points (/newrec, /new, etc.) will be matched here.

    # Group 3: General Callback Query Handlers
    # These are for button interactions on existing trade cards (e.g., "Update Price").
    # They are registered last to ensure that any callback query that is part of an
    # active conversation is handled by the conversation handler first.
