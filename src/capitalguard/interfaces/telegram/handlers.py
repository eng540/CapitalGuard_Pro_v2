# File: src/capitalguard/interfaces/telegram/handlers.py
# Version: v30.0.0-R2 (Cleaned Registrar)
# ✅ THE FIX: (R2 Architecture)
#    - 1. (CLEAN) هذا الملف هو الآن "المُسجّل" (Registrar) النظيف.
#    - 2. (Consolidated) لا يزال يستدعي `register_conversation_handlers`
#       و `register_management_handlers`، وهو يعتمد الآن على هيكلتها الداخلية الجديدة
#       التي تفصل بين (Stateful) و (Stateless).
# 🎯 IMPACT: نقطة دخول التسجيل الآن نظيفة ومتوافقة مع "الأرض الواسعة".
