    # The callback for the handler above is None, but we must pass the filter to the handler's constructor.
    # A cleaner way in newer PTB versions might exist, but this is a robust approach.
    # Let's refine this to be cleaner. We can make a dummy handler.
    
    # A better approach for the above:
    # We will apply the ENSURE_USER_FILTER to a high-priority group that catches all commands and messages.
    # Let's create a dummy handler for this.
    
    # Let's reconsider. The best place to ensure the user is created is within the decorators
    # and the /start command itself, as that's the true entry point.
    # The previous `auth.py` logic was actually better. Let's revert that part.
    # The issue was not the filter, but the lack of applying it.
    
    # Let's stick to the decorator-based approach as it's more explicit.
    # The previous `auth.py` file is correct. The issue is applying the logic.

    # Final Decision: The decorator approach is cleaner. The issue was that /start
    # did not create the user. We will fix that in `commands.py`. The `auth.py`
    # file from the previous answer is correct. The `handlers.py` file should
    # simply register the handlers in the correct order.
